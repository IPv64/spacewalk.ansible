Spacewalk playbooks and roles
==============

Install a full Spacewalk server on CentOS 7 and also adds:
- CentOS 6 repo, channel and activation key (+epel)
- CentOS 7 repo, channel and activation key(+epel)
- Ubuntu 14.04 repo, channel and activation key
- Ubuntu 12.04 repo, channel and activation key

To do:

- Add ubuntu support to client role
- Update client role to automatically pick EPEL for activation key
- Look at also adding Debian Jessie/Wheezy
